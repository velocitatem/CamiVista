  > Why does Spain have so many great highways?

This project aims to track traffic in Spain and provide a visualization of the traffic in real time. The data is obtained from the [DGT](https://opendata.dgt.es/) (Dirección General de Tráfico).

Over time, with enough data, we might be able to infer the general migration patterns of the Spanish population. Identify dead zones, and even predict traffic jams.
